### Shortcode

A Shortcode named **'name_of_slider'** will be generated. You can use it in pages and post using syntax :
```
[name_of_slider]
```
ex. if you have slider name 'Bikes' then shortcode of that slider will be [Bikes].

**Note** - On plugin Deactivation All the Sliders and images in the sliders will be lost. you can again create Sliders and insert images.
